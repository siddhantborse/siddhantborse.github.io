### The data set compliant of 891 people on board and the other columns gives out the information about them such as Class, Passenger name, Sex of the passenger, Age of the passenger, Ticket number, Fare and weather they have survived or not.
By studying the dataset, we can find out the following details that depicts which kind of people have survived the sink, this can be determined by knowing the cabin number/ ticket number of the passenger and also the age group/sex of the individual and predict the safe spectrum to travel with for survival rate. After analyzing the data, we can predict that if a costlier ticket can increase your survival rate or not, around 350 people survived the sink in which the survival rate of male was around 0.18 and that of women was 0.7 which means the survival rate of women is more than that of man.
